# Kirby Migrations

This plugin provides a simple migrations setup for [Kirby CMS](https://getkirby.com/).

Use cases might be **database migrations** for your SQL database, **migrating content** or
**creating pages** when deploying your Kirby page.

⚠️ This plugin is still heavily under development. So don’t consider any API stable.

Documentation following soon.
